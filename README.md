# 📈 Betwise – Decentralized Prediction Market Engine

**Betwise** is a high-performance engine for a decentralized **prediction market** platform, inspired by systems like [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/). It allows users to buy and sell shares on the outcomes of future events with dynamic market-based pricing.

The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and real-time. Orders are processed in-memory for ultra-fast matching, while persistence and analytics are handled asynchronously via Redis-backed workers and PostgreSQL.

> Think of it as a mini NASDAQ for betting on real-world questions like:
> - "Will Bitcoin hit $100K by Dec 2025?"
> - "Will India win the Cricket World Cup 2027?"
> - "Will OpenAI release GPT-5 by Q2 2026?"

## 🧠 How It Works

1. API receives a request like `POST /buy`.
2. API constructs an `Input` struct and sends it to Redis (`input` queue).
3. **Engine Worker** consumes `input`, processes the logic, and pushes:
   - Result to `output` (for API response)
   - Matching deltas to `order_events` (for DB persistence)
4. API reads from `output` and returns the result.
5. **Database Worker** reads `order_events` and:
   - Creates, updates, or deletes orders
   - Modifies INR and stock balances
